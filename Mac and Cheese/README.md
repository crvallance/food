## Ingredients

- Half a box of noodles
  - Whatever you want, I actually like large shells  
- 2 tablespoons of "butter"
  - I'm using smart balance to make it vegan
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- 3/4 cup of "milk"
  - I use almond milk to make it vegan
- 1/2 cup of pasta water
  - Reserve this when you drain your pasta
- 1 cup shredded cheese
  - Maybe more if you want it cheesier
  - You don't _have_ to shred it but it'll be much easier to melt if you do

## Cooking

The magic here is timing.  I try to have everything ready so I can make my sauce when the noodles go in.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, whatever it's still mac and cheese.

### Pasta

- Cook pasta to desired hardness
  - I tend to go towards the al dente side so I can let thermal drift happen.
- Reserve about a half cup of water while draining

### Sauce

Bechamel? Roux?  I don't know, I'm not fancy cook guy, it's "butter", flour, "milk", and then cheese.

- Melt your "butter"
- Add in the flour and start whisking
  - Once it starts to clump up a bit, add a bit of "milk"
- Slowly add "milk" and let it thicken
  - Keep going until you're out of "milk"
  - Whisk the whole time, try not to let anything brown or burn
- Add in cheese until it's melted and incorporated
- Add in pasta water to make the sauce creamier
  - The starches in the water help keep things together while thinning the sauce.  If you're used to bright orange mac and cheese from a box, you'll want more water so your sauce is runnier.

## Construction / Serving

Dump it all together and serve.

Again, my family loves the broiler, so we would often put this in a glass (or otherwise oven safe dish) and then add thin slices of tomato over top and then a light layer of more shredded cheese.  Pop under the broiler until the cheese is whatever level of melted you like (I like mine browned).

Serve lots of cracked pepper and veg on the side.  I'm (still) partial to peas but have been known to use some sort of heathen frozen veg mix in a pinch or brussels sprouts when I'm feeling fancy.  

## Alternate Adjustments

- Toss in some Coleman's mustard in to your sauce when you're adding cheese for some tang.  

- Go full heathen like I do adding in sauted mushrooms, jalapeno, and peas directly when you add in the sauce.

- Add in hot sauce because cheese and hot sauce always go together
