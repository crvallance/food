# Shepherdless Pie

Adapted from family recipie and has a very "figure it out along the way" organization.  We rarely had true Shepherd's with actual lamb so I'd consider this a variation on a cottage pie.

## Ingredients (Basic Version)

- 3 large baking potatoes
  - Sometimes I go with 4 if I want lots of mash)  
- 1 lb (16 oz) veggie crumbles
  - Again, adjust if you want more not-meat
  - Morningstar used to be my standard but if you want more meat-like flavour go with the Beyond ground
- 1 large teaspoon of Marmite (optional)
  - This matters less when using Beyond but still adds nice flavour
- 1/2 measure of Bisto (optional)
  - Instructions make a lot, so I do half.  The granules can be found in World Market these days.  Again, not totally needed when using beyond but I still like it.
- 1 medium onion
- Fat as needed for mash
  - I'm using smart balance these days so it's vegan but use butter if you prefer.  I have no idea how much, put enough in until the potatoes taste good
- Salt / Pepper as needed for taste
  
## Cooking

- Cut and boil potatoes, add butter, mash -> mashed potatoes
  - Yeah, yeah these aren't good instructions.  Go read somewhere else how to make mashed potatoes, that's all we're doing here.
- Chop and saute onion
- Brown "meat" (adding to onion)
  - If using beyond this will actually cook up with the fat so brown it like you might when using beef.
  - If you're using something else, just get it warm and maybe add some fat (olive oil, butter, whatever)
  - Add in Marmite while browning
- Add Bisto in to create desired consistency
  - Beware of over adding unless like you it sloppy
  - If using Beyond, you might consider adding a smaller amount so it doesn't get to salty tasting.
- Salt / Pepper as desired

## Construction / Serving

You can simply put potatoes on meat and serve but my family has always put this in a glass (or otherwise oven safe dish) and then stuck under a broiler until the top browns nicely.  Try using a fork to rough up the taters (precious) to get nice crisp.

Serve with veg on the side.  I'm partial to peas but have been known to use some sort of heathen frozen veg mix in a pinch.  

Cheese is blasphemy but here I am telling you how to make this without meat so, you do you.

## Alternate Adjustments

- Peel and cook 2-3 large parsnips and then throw them in with the potatoes when you mash them.  It will give a pleasant sweetness.  

- You could also consider swapping out a baking potato for a sweet potato but the parsnip is definitely more on the British side.

- Add your veg right in to the "meat" while browning.  All of this is firmly in cottage pie territory anyway, just figure out what you like.
